    "A measure of central tendency is a single value that attempts to describe a set of data by identifying the central position within that set of data. As such, measures of central tendency are sometimes called measures of central location. They are also classified as summary statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a measure of central tendency is to provide a summary of the data with a single number that represents the center or middle of its distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean (Arithmetic Mean):** The sum of all the data entries divided by the number of entries. This is the most common measure of central tendency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median:** The middle value when the data entries are arranged in ascending (or descending) order. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n",

    "3. **Mode:** The most frequently occurring value in a data set.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The arithmetic mean, often simply called the mean, is the average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding up all the numbers in the set and then dividing by the count of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:** If we have a set of numbers $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$, the arithmetic mean is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Arithmetic Mean} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:** The arithmetic mean represents a \"flattening out\" of the numbers. It is the value that each number would need to be in order for the total of the set to remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:** The arithmetic mean is used in a wide range of applications, from basic mathematics and statistics to economics and data analysis. It provides a simple measure of central tendency, giving a quick sense of the \"middle\" of a data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cautions:** The arithmetic mean can be heavily influenced by outliers. A single very large or very small value can significantly affect the mean, potentially giving a misleading impression of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:** The arithmetic mean assumes that all numbers in the set are equally important and contribute equally to the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Consider the numbers 6, 11, and 7. The arithmetic mean is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the numbers: 6 + 11 + 7 = 24\n",
    "Divide by how many numbers (there are 3 numbers): 24 / 3 = 8\n",

    "- $(x_{n/2} + x_{n/2 + 1}) / 2$ when n is even\n",

    "**Intuition:** The median represents the \"middle\" of a data set, with half of the values being less than the median and half being greater. It is not influenced by outliers or extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:** The median is often used in situations where the data may be skewed or have outliers. It provides a measure of central tendency that is more robust to these issues than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cautions:** The median only considers the middle values of the data set and does not take into account the actual values of the data points. Therefore, it may not accurately represent the data if the values are widely spread or have multiple modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:** The median assumes that the data is ordered. It does not assume that all values are equally important.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Consider the numbers 3, 5, and 8. Arranged in ascending order, they are 3, 5, 8. As there are 3 numbers, which is odd, the median is the middle number, which is 5.\n"

    "**Intuition:** The weighted mean gives more importance to some values over others. It is useful when we want to calculate an average that is not uniformly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:** The weighted mean is often used in situations where some data points contribute more to the final average than others. This could be in grading systems, where different assignments have different weights, or in finance, where different investments have different levels of risk.\n",

    "**Cautions:** The weighted mean can be influenced by the weights assigned to the values. If the weights are not accurately reflecting the importance or frequency of the values, the weighted mean can be misleading.\n",

    "**Intuition:** The truncated mean helps to reduce the impact of outliers on the calculated mean.\n",

    "**Use Case:** The geometric mean is often used in finance and investing, where it can give a more accurate picture of returns over time than the arithmetic mean. It's also used in geometry and in situations where the numbers being averaged are ratios or rates.\n",
