    "- **Definition**: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in a machine learning model by adding a penalty term to the loss function. The penalty term discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "- **Use Case and Intuition**: Regularization is used when a model is overfitting the training data, i.e., it performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data. The intuition behind regularization is to keep the weights of the model small, which makes the model simpler and less likely to overfit.\n",
    "- **Formula**: In the case of L2 regularization (also known as Ridge regression), the penalty term is the sum of the squares of the model weights, multiplied by the regularization parameter (λ). In the case of L1 regularization (also known as Lasso regression), the penalty term is the sum of the absolute values of the model weights, multiplied by the regularization parameter.\n",
