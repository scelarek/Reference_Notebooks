# Reference_Notebooks
Notebooks that I use as references in my projects.

These notebooks are made with the assistance of GPT-4 and then checked by me. They are not perfect, but they are a good starting point for any project.

An example of some of the prompts I used to create these notebooks are:

```
- Please give me a MarkDown cheatsheet for these classification and regression algorithms in the sklearn library for ML
[[Logistic Regression]]
[[K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm]]
[[Decision Tree]]
[[Linear Regression]]
[[Support Vector Machine Algorithm]]s
[[Naive Bayes Algorithm]]

- Please have bullet points with these topics filled in:
    - Intuition behind the ML algorithm
    - Use case for the ML algorithm
    - The intuition for using it for classification (if possible)
    - The intuition for using it for regression (if possible)
    - Also please put the formula for probability (if possible)
    - The Formula for the Cost function (if possible)
    - How to code the ML algorithm
    - The most important hyperparameters to tune (if relevant)
        - if relevant, put the code to tune them here
    - Assumptions of the ML Model that have to be met. Be exhaustive here.
    - How to interpret the models coefficients
