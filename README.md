# Reference_Notebooks
Notebooks that I use as references in my projects.

These notebooks are made with the assistance of GPT-4 (The June 22nd Model with Wolfram Alpha and Scholar AI Plug-Ins) and then checked over and reformatted by me. 

**They are not perfect and I'm afraid some parts of it may even be wrong.** I would only use these as a reference for code, and to refresh some of the concepts that you already know. NOT to learn them the first time, or if you aren't familiar with some of the characteristics of all the terms. Regardless of their flaws, they have been an invaluable tool and reference for some of my projects and I thought I would share them here.

An example of some of the GPT-4 prompts I used to create these notebooks are:
```
- Please give me a MarkDown cheatsheet for these classification and regression algorithms in the sklearn library for ML
[[Logistic Regression]]
[[K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm]]
[[Decision Tree]]
[[Linear Regression]]
[[Support Vector Machine Algorithm]]s
[[Naive Bayes Algorithm]]

- Please have bullet points with these topics filled in:
    - Intuition behind the ML algorithm
    - Use case for the ML algorithm
    - The intuition for using it for classification (if possible)
    - The intuition for using it for regression (if possible)
    - Also please put the formula for probability (if possible)
    - The Formula for the Cost function (if possible)
    - How to code the ML algorithm
    - The most important hyperparameters to tune (if relevant)
        - if relevant, put the code to tune them here
    - Assumptions of the ML Model that have to be met. Be exhaustive here.
    - How to interpret the models coefficients
