**Project Reference Notebooks**

This repository contains a collection of notebooks that serve as references for my projects. These notebooks are created using the assistance of GPT-4, specifically the June 22nd model with Wolfram Alpha and Scholar AI plug-ins. After their generation, I carefully review and reformat them.

**Please Note**: While these cheat sheets can be helpful, they may contain errors due to my limited expertise in certain subject areas. It is advised not to solely rely on them for learning new concepts.

**Use Case**: These notebooks serve as a valuable resource for code snippets and concept refreshers. They have proven to be invaluable in various projects and I am sharing them here for others to benefit from.


An example of some of the GPT-4 prompts I used to create these notebooks are:
```
- Please give me a MarkDown cheatsheet for these classification and regression algorithms in the sklearn library for ML
[[Logistic Regression]]
[[K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm]]
[[Decision Tree]]
[[Linear Regression]]
[[Support Vector Machine Algorithm]]s
[[Naive Bayes Algorithm]]

- Please have bullet points with these topics filled in:
    - Intuition behind the ML algorithm
    - Use case for the ML algorithm
    - The intuition for using it for classification (if possible)
    - The intuition for using it for regression (if possible)
    - Also please put the formula for probability (if possible)
    - The Formula for the Cost function (if possible)
    - How to code the ML algorithm
    - The most important hyperparameters to tune (if relevant)
        - if relevant, put the code to tune them here
    - Assumptions of the ML Model that have to be met. Be exhaustive here.
    - How to interpret the models coefficients
